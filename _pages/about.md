I am a PhD student in the international doctoral program IDEALAB. I am researching at the University of Potsdam (Germany) and Macquarie University (Australia). I study how infants perceive linguistic units in songs and how language development is influenced by their musicality. I am also interested in questions related to the (co)evolution of music and language. 

My interest in developmental linguistics was shaped by Prof. Ball-Avetisian, who gave me my first ever academic job as a research assistant in her C07 project (CRC1287 of the University of Potsdam). Later, she became the first supervisor of my Master's thesis together with Rowena Garcia. In this project, I conducted daylong recordings of the language input received by Ukrainian refugee children. 

Before my work in academia, I worked in creative industries, first assisting at exhibitions in a contemporary art museum and then moving to the music industry. I was involved in music festival coordination, interview assistance, and participation in music PR campaigns. I love working close to music and interacting with people, and Iâ€™m lucky to be able to do this regularly in my current research project. 

In my free time, I often sing and play the piano, synths, or jam with others. I also like playing computer games and going to the gym or yoga.
